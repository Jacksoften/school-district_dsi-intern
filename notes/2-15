figured out how to get the data of lines and rects
then transfer rects to lines


but Nick's code fails for lines_to_cells
for pdf BearValley...2015_2016
page15


in geometry.R, line16, returned line = NULL
status: have not figured out the reason

possile cause:
lines = lines[lines[4,] - lines[2, ], tol_y]
it might be lines[lines[,4] - lines[,2], tol_y]



##TODO
try to plot out the structure of the boxes then extract texts
from boxes


Duncan has added new function getBBox{,2} to ReadPDF, we may check it
 to see if it is applicable in our function
