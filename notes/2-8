Tried to understand how Nick deal with the lines and cells and rects.

Tried to modify main.r function to only test on one file, but
BearValleyUnified failed.

It does extract the text, but failed at sec2_parse()

## TODO
1. need to find out the reason.
2. modify the function to extract more infomations.
